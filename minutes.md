## First meeting (Sep 15th 2019)
Agenda: 
1. Team norms
2. How Sprint works
3. User stories
4. Definition of Done
5. Project management tool

### Main points: 
1. Two main branches on each repo, `master` and `develop`. The former one should serve as stable/release branch, while the later is for constant development. 
2. All code must be merged through _pull requests_ to `develop` branch from a feature branch first prior to `master` branch.  `e.g feature/kurtosis_interface -> develop  -> master` .
3.   _pull requests_ to `develop` branch requires at least one approval review.   `master` branch would require all team members approval review.
4. Sprint interval is set to 2 weeks. At the end of each sprint, team will host sprint review and planning meeting (Sunday morning. Time TBD)
5. User stories should represent a feature/functionality that are ideally small, easy to test and review.
6. Unit testing is one of the acceptance criteria of User story
7. [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ui64CxlG/dev) is the Agile management tool 
8. Team should review _pull requests_ in an efficient manner to avoid merging conflicts

### Tasks: 
1. Create user stories in the backlog
2. Set up local develop enviornment
3. Get familiar with the work flow (Github pull requests, merging to develop, master, etc)  (Updating documentation for our Github Org is a good example)
4. Get familiar with  [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ui64CxlG/dev)]
